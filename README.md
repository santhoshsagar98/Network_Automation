# Network_Automation

This project is about deploying different configurations to cisco routers and testing it. For this purpose, a virtual networking environment was set up in GNS3 and launched in a ubuntu VM. All the scripts were written in python and I started with using the paramiko module. Then later moved onto using netmiko and napalm as well. I am working on Ansible to automate the process and once its done. I shall upload that as well. Each script is pretty straight forward and will run straight away.
